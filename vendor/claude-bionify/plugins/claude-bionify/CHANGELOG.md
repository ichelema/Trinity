# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-bionify are documented here. This project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org) and [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- Non-ASCII characters no longer garble on Windows. Python decodes a pipe with
  the system ANSI codepage rather than UTF-8, so em dashes and curly quotes in
  Claude's replies arrived corrupted before being bolded. The hook now reads its
  event as bytes and lets JSON decode it. Thanks to @aermak for the report.
- `/claude-bionify:status` and the other control commands no longer emit an
  undecodable separator on Windows. The status line is now written as UTF-8
  bytes instead of being encoded with the platform codepage, which produced a
  broken glyph on Western systems and failed outright on Japanese ones.
- `assets/generate_themes.py` reads and writes UTF-8 explicitly, so regenerating
  `themes.svg` produces the same file on any platform.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-12

### Changed
- The claude-bionify skill now confirms the plugin is installed before giving
  settings or command guidance. Skill marketplaces can surface the skill on its
  own, so when the plugin is missing the skill now says so and points to the
  install commands instead of walking through controls that are not there.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Preserve fenced code blocks that use spaced info strings such as
  ```` ``` python ````.
- Stop URL protection before surrounding quotes and brackets.
- Reject invalid boolean and minimum-word-length live override values instead
  of silently applying surprising settings.
- Save live overrides correctly when `CLAUDE_BIONIFY_STATE_FILE` is set to a
  filename in the current working directory.
- Use fully-qualified `/claude-bionify:set ...` examples in the plugin README.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-28

Initial release.

### Added
- `MessageDisplay` hook that bolds the leading part of each word in Claude's
  streamed replies as they render. The change is display-only: the saved
  transcript and what Claude reads are never altered.
- Unicode-aware bolding that works in any language, while leaving numbers and
  identifiers like `value3` or `api_key` alone.
- Three bolding strategies via the `boundary` option: `fraction` (default),
  `syllable` (ends at the first syllable), and `log` (long words bolded less).
- Configurable `fixation` strength and `min_word_length`.
- `skip_acronyms` (default on) leaves ALL-CAPS acronyms like `API` whole.
- `protect_urls` (default on) keeps URLs, emails, and file paths unbolded, while
  still bolding prose like `and/or` or `e.g.`.
- `skip_headings` (default on) leaves markdown headings unbolded.
- Inline `` `code` ``, fenced code blocks, markdown links, and existing
  `**bold**` always render verbatim.
- Live control commands (`/claude-bionify:on`, `:off`, `:toggle`,
  `:set <option> <value>`, `:status`, `:reset`) that change settings mid-session
  with no reload.
- Seven color themes (Nord, Dracula, Gruvbox, Solarized Dark, Solarized Light,
  Sepia, Focus Dark) in Claude Code's `/theme` picker as `custom:claude-bionify:<name>`.
- Crash-safe by design: on any error the original text is shown unchanged.
